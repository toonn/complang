<h1 id="exercise-session-functional-reactive-programming-elm">Exercise session Functional Reactive Programming (Elm)</h1>
<p>In this session, you will learn to work with Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Elm programming language.</p>
<p>The session consists of 6 exercises, which you can find in the same zip-file as this assignment, under the names Oef1.elm to Oef6.elm. Each file contains the assignment for the exercise.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-elm">Working with Elm</h2>
<p>To use Elm, unzip the assignments to a directory cpl-elm-oefenzitting in your home directory. Then open a Terminal and run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/cpl-elm-oefenzitting/
elm-reactor</code></pre>
<p>Then minimize the Terminal screen, but DO NOT CLOSE IT. You can then open a browser at <a href="http://localhost:8000/">this URL</a> and either run or debug the programs in that directory. We recommend you edit the elm files using editor Kate or GEdit and set highlighting mode to Haskell. If you debug an application, it is by default hotswapped, i.e. your changes are directly reflected in the running application when you save.</p>
